Create a small web app in React, with the following specs :

- App specs:
  - The app must fetch users data from [Random Data API](https://random-data-api.com/) when started or refreshed.
  - When data is retrieved, the app must display a card for each user, containing its information (photo, name, etc.).
  - The app must display a button which refreshes the list of users when clicked.
  - You must provide the app user a way of setting the number of cards he wants to display and fetch as many users as needed.
- Coding guidelines:
  - You must separate you code into components. Each component must be reusable.
  - You must avoid hardcoded values inside your code. Use constants at top of file with `UPPER_CASE` when needed.
  - You must use React hooks (state, effect).
  - You must use React functional components.
  - You must comment your code.
  - You must use version control, adding one commit for each instruction at least.
